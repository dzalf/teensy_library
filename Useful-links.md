#Compendium of useful resources for the Teensy Family


**Teensy 3.2 to 3.6**
(13/03/2023) It should be noted that the Teensy 3.x family of boards is unfortunately reaching its EOL. 
It has been announced by PRJC that due to supply chain and manufacture issues, the Teensy 3.2 will be no more (:sad:). More information here: https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html

**Teensy 4.0**

*It should be noted that the initial revisions were shipped with pinout
cards missing the reference to SPI1 (CS1 and MOSI1). More info here: https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/58128-Teensy-4-0-SPI-pins

*Contributed 3D model available here: https://grabcad.com/library/teensy-4-0-1

*Library to read the internal temperature from some Teensy boards, like 3/LC and 4.x (not tested. Refer to the library for further info)
